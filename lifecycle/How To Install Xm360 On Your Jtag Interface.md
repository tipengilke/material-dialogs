## What You Need
 
- A Jtag or RGH Xbox 360 console
- A USB flash drive formatted to FAT32
- A computer with an internet connection
- The latest version of Xm360 (you can download it from [here](https://digiex.net/threads/xm360-2-0d-download-xbox-360-jtag-xbla-dlc-tu-content-organiser.4897/))

## Step 1: Copy Xm360 To Your USB Flash Drive
 
Extract the Xm360 zip file on your computer and copy the folder named "Xm360" to the root of your USB flash drive. The folder should contain two files: "default.xex" and "xm360.cfg". Eject your USB flash drive from your computer and plug it into your Xbox 360 console.
 
## Step 2: Launch Xm360 From Your Jtag Interface
 
Turn on your Xbox 360 console and navigate to your Jtag interface. Depending on what dashboard you are using, you may have different options to launch Xm360. For example, if you are using Freestyle Dash, you can go to "Games" and then "Xbox 360 Games". You should see Xm360 listed as one of the games. Select it and press A to launch it. If you are using XexMenu, you can go to "USB0" and then "Xm360". Select "default.xex" and press A to launch it.
 
## Step 3: Use Xm360 To Manage Your Games And DLCs
 
Once Xm360 is launched, you will see a menu with four options: "Scan All Devices", "Scan Current Device", "Settings", and "Exit". You can use the left stick or the D-pad to navigate the menu and press A to select an option. If you want to scan all the devices connected to your console for games and DLCs, select "Scan All Devices". If you want to scan only the device where Xm360 is located (in this case, your USB flash drive), select "Scan Current Device". The scanning process may take a few minutes depending on how many games and DLCs you have.
 
After the scanning is done, you will see a list of games and DLCs on the left side of the screen. You can use the left stick or the D-pad to scroll through the list and press A to select an item. On the right side of the screen, you will see some information about the selected item, such as its name, size, status, and path. You can also see some options at the bottom of the screen, such as "Unlock", "Delete", "Copy", and "Move". You can use the right stick or the shoulder buttons to switch between these options and press A to execute them.
 
If you want to unlock a game or a DLC, select it from the list and then select "Unlock" from the options. This will make the game or DLC playable on any console without requiring a license. If you want to delete a game or a DLC, select it from the list and then select "Delete" from the options. This will permanently remove the game or DLC from your device. If you want to copy or move a game or a DLC, select it from the list and then select "Copy" or "Move" from the options. This will allow you to choose another device or folder as the destination for the game or DLC.

It allows you to scan your devices for games and DLCs, unlock them, delete them, or copy them to another location.
