If you want to play Rayman Origins on your Wii console, you will need to download a ROM file of the game and a WBFS file manager. A ROM file is a digital copy of a game disc, and a WBFS file manager is a software that allows you to transfer the ROM file to a USB drive or an SD card that can be read by the Wii. Here are the steps to download and play Rayman Origins on Wii:
 
1. Go to [Vimm's Lair](https://vimm.net/vault/17998) [^1^] and search for Rayman Origins. Click on the game title and then click on "Download" to get the ROM file of the game. The file size is 3.44 GB and the format is .wbfs.
2. Go to [WBFS Manager](https://wbfsmanager.com/) and download the latest version of the software. Install it on your computer and run it.
3. Connect a USB drive or an SD card to your computer and format it to WBFS using the WBFS Manager. This will erase all the data on the drive or card, so make sure you back up any important files before doing this.
4. Click on "Browse" and select the drive or card that you formatted. Then click on "Add" and select the ROM file of Rayman Origins that you downloaded. The file will be transferred to the drive or card.
5. Eject the drive or card from your computer and plug it into your Wii console. Make sure your Wii is modded to run homebrew applications. If not, you can follow this [guide](https://wii.guide/) to do so.
6. Launch the homebrew channel on your Wii and run a USB loader application, such as [USB Loader GX](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/USB_Loader_GX). Select Rayman Origins from the list of games and enjoy!
